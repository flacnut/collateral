# Collateral

An improvement on Mint.com for transaction analysis.

Proposed:

- Fully offline, all data generated from statements rather than connections to accounts.
- Tag transactions for logical grouping
- Fetch ETF makeup for stock/risk exposure & track stock price daily for account value.
- Handle different currencies including currency fluctuations daily.
- Detect / plan with understanding of recurring transactions volume & value.
